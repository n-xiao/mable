# About
Mable is a simple, free and open source deadline manager for Windows 11 and MacOS Sequoia (or later). 
It is built to make the management of many ongoing, concurrent deadlines easier. Mable allows you to see the 
number of days which remain for each deadline in a sorted list, automatically counting down the days. This makes
it easy for you to see which deadline is most (or least) urgent.
Mable is inspired by the [Bears Countdown App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bears-countdown/id1536711520) 
on iOS and the visual aesthetics of [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).


# Updates
Please note that Mable does not come with an update manager and **will not automatically update**. You are encouraged to check this repository
periodically for any updates.

# Contributing
Unfortunately, I am not accepting any contributions to this repository at this time as I am rather unfamiliar with how Github works
and I would want to minimise the risk of data loss due to any repository management-related mistakes.
Once I get the time to learn more, I will definitely allow code contributions.
