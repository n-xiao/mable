## Installation Guides
Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/n-xiao/mable/wiki/Installing-Mable) to install Mable.

You can also build it from source.

## About
Mable is an application which allows you to create Countdowns — it counts down the days till a date you set.
When a Countdown approaches or passes its due date, the built-in *Heads Up Display*
will update, showing you how many Countdowns are either overdue, due today or due tomorrow. Mable is **not**
intended to replace your Calendar or To-Do list. Instead, it provides you with a quick overview about how much time
you have left for multiple deadlines.

## Features
 * Free of charge. Free to use. *it's built for you.*
 * Folders allow you to view a selection of Countdowns at a time. *keeping the riff-raff out!*
 * Autosaving to local storage. *works offline, with no strings attached*
 * Resizable window. *you got a wide-screen? USE IT.*
 * Procedurally-generated UI. *for the aesthetics*
 * Dark mode. Only. *one of the perks of being in beta... no light mode yet, sorry!*

## Roadmap
All new features are paused for the time being while I work on getting the documentation setup and fix bugs.
However, some planned features include:
 - User settings + light mode option
 - Toast notifications (e.g "added new task!" or "created new folder!")
 - Undo and redo function (this one might be tough)
