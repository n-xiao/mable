# About
Mable is a simple, free and open source deadline manager for Windows and MacOS. 
It is built to make the management of many ongoing, concurrent deadlines easier. Mable allows you to see the 
number of days which remain for each deadline in a sorted list, automatically counting down the days. This makes
it easy for you to see which deadline is most (or least) urgent.
Mable is inspired by the [Bears Countdown App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bears-countdown/id1536711520) 
on iOS and the visual aesthetics of [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).
