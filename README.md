## About
Mable is an application which allows you to create Countdowns — it counts down the days till a date you set.
When a Countdown approaches or passes its due date, the built-in *Heads Up Display*
will update, showing you how many Countdowns are either overdue, due today or due tomorrow. Mable is **not**
intended to replace your Calendar or To-Do list. Instead, it provides you with a quick overview about how much time
you have left for multiple deadlines.

## Features
- Add and remove Countdowns easily
- Shift-Click + Meta-Click functionality for selecting multiple Countdowns
- Drag n' Drop to organise Countdowns
- Mark Countdowns as Completed
- Add and remove Folders
- Search for Folders
- Number of Countdowns that are Overdue, Due today or Due tomorrow at a glance
- Auto-saves to local storage
- Scrollable views
- Free of charge

## Roadmap
All new features are paused for the time being while I work on getting the documentation setup and fix bugs.
However, some planned features include:
 - User settings + light mode option
 - Toast notifications (e.g "added new task!" or "created new folder!")
 - Undo and redo function (this one might be tough)

## Contributing
If you have an issue and/or want to contribute to the codebase, I recommend you start with reading
