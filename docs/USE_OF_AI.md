# Use of Artifical Intelligence
As the owner of the Mable project, it is my opinion that Large Language Models (LLMs), herein referred to as Slop Generators, are
completely **unsuitable** and **inappropriate** for use as a software engineering tool for Mable's development.
<br></br>
<h3 align="center">
    The use of Slop Generators in any contributions to the Mable project is strictly forbidden.
</h3>
<br></br>

This is because of my views on Slop Generators:
1. [Programming ≠ Prompting Slop Generators](https://github.com/n-xiao/mable-private/blob/dev/docs/USE_OF_AI.md#programming-is-not-prompting)
2. [Slop Generators use stolen works](https://github.com/n-xiao/mable-private/blob/dev/docs/USE_OF_AI.md#stolen-work)
4. [Slop Generators are convincingly incorrect](https://github.com/n-xiao/mable-private/blob/dev/docs/USE_OF_AI.md#convincingly-incorrect)
5. [Slop Generators can create security vulnerabilities](https://github.com/n-xiao/mable-private/blob/dev/docs/USE_OF_AI.md#security-concerns)

## Programming IS NOT Prompting
Programming is, and always has been, the act of writing code. I don't care if you're typing with a fancy keyboard
or using your toes to type, or are doing it on paper. *You* are writing code. *You* think and solve problems as you write.

The term "Vibe Coding" is used to try and normalise the use of Slop Generators in programming.
But it's essentially flipping a coin to make decisions at each step of the development process:

- *For whom should this app be designed for?* Flip a coin
- *What size should this button be?* Flip a coin.
- *What colour scheme should I use?* Flip a coin.
- *How should I handle user data securely?* Flip a coin.
- etc. etc.

So, my point is simple:
<br></br>
<h4 align="center">
    Thinking is <it>discouraged</it> when using a Slop Generator.
    <br></br>
</h4>
<p align="center">
    To create good software, you <b>need to think</b> carefully and organically.
</p>
<br></br>

## Stolen work
Many Slop Generators use datasets trained across an extremely
large scale, with much of such data originating from the internet. It is not unlikely that copyrighted work
are included in training data without proper consent, with Slop Generators likely to regurgitate
stolen work at any given moment.
<br></br>
<h4 align="center">
    Using stolen work is wrong. It has no place in Mable's development.
</h4>
<br></br>

## Convincingly incorrect
In a project such as Mable, where even the slightest of unconventional techniques are used, Slop Generators can
generate faulty code when it encounters something outside its training data.
The problem is not necessarily the incorrect slop that is spat out, but how Slop Generators
have the capabilities to be extremely convincing, regardless of actual competency.

Additionally, since the 1966, the [ELIZA effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect) has been shown
to be an easy means of captivating the human mind. Certain Slop Generators are designed with the intention of keeping a
conversation going. As programmers, focus is of utmost importance and we cannot afford
to get distracted by so-called "tools" or "assistants" or "chains of matrices in a stochastic system".
<br></br>
<h4 align="center">
    Don't play mind games. Just write code.
</h4>
<br></br>

## Security concerns
A considerable number of Slop Generators involve the collection and use of arbitrary data in real-time, such as
from a website that a Slop Generator user is currently visiting.
And, when it is difficult to differentiate between genuine and malicious data,
such as with Slop Generator prompts, you can get prompt injection vulnerabilities.
Open Source is based on collaboration. Be responsible, and be secure.
<br></br>
<h4 align="center">
    You know what's bad for you. Slop Generators don't.
</h4>
<br></br>

## What you can do
If you wish to decrease your dependence on Slop Generators, here are some tips:

**When researching**

- Pretend Slop Generators do not exist
- Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) as your search engine. It allows you to **disable AI overviews**
- For information related to Java, always start your search with the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/index.html). If you need dark mode, get [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/)
- For information related to JavaFX, start your search with the [JavaFX documentation](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/25/index.html)

**When troubleshooting**

* Never copy and paste error messages into a Slop Generator's prompt
* Check if your question has been asked on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)
- Use [Geeks4Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) for tutorials


## A side note
As a recent highschool graduate, it was really depressing
when someone came along with a seemingly detailed and well-done program/project but not
be able to say anything about it when asked because they "just asked \[insert Slop Generator\]"
and it turns out to be a buggy mess.

Personally, I prefer waiting for a person to come up with something themselves (even if it's not perfect)
because they spent that time; it's an effort that is *genuine* — the opposite of artifical.

I have adapted portions of this document from the
[Asahi Linux Slop Generator Policy](https://asahilinux.org/docs/project/policies/slop/)
because I love what they had to say. It's one of the best pieces of text I've read on why Slop Generators
have no place in the Free and Open Source movement. If you're interested, please check out their [awesome project](https://asahilinux.org/)!
